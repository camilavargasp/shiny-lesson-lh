## What is Shiny?

An R package that allows users to create an interactive web application using R code. This packages calls for HTML, JavaScript and CSS without you having to learn them.

Think interactive web pages built by people who love to code in R, no JavaScript experience necessary.

> "Shiny is an open source R package that provides an elegant and powerful web framework for building web applications using R. Shiny helps you turn your analyses into interactive web applications without requiring HTML, CSS, or JavaScript knowledge.” - Posit

The big benefits of Shiny is that you create an interactive web application just by understanding the Shiny framework in R and present all the cool visualization you create using R packages in an interactive platform.

### Why build a Shiny App? {.unnumbered}

-   Share data in an engaging format - allowing your audience to interact with your data. Example: [HydroTech Helper](https://danielkerstan.shinyapps.io/usgs_water_data/?_inputs_&state=%22%22) by Daniel Kerstan. An app to access real-time monitoring of USGS hydrology sites.

-   To make tools you create in R accessible to others. Particularly those who do not know R. Instead of sharing your code, you share your app and everyone can see the output. Example: [Marine Mammal Bycatch Impacts App](https://msiple.shinyapps.io/mmrefpoints/) by Dr. Margaret Siple. [Source code](https://github.com/mcsiple/mmrefpoints)

-   Create resources for others to use. Example: [Novel-gazing App](https://msiple.shinyapps.io/NovelGazingApp/) by Dr. Margaret Siple. [Source code](https://github.com/mcsiple/novelgazing)

## The Anatomy of a Shiny App

### What are the building blocks of a Shiny app?{.unnumbered}


Shiny apps are composed in two parts: 

1. A web page that displays the app to a user (i.e. the user interface, or UI for short - frontend), and
2. A computer that powers the app (i.e. the server - backend)



![Source: Intro to Shiny - Building reactive apps and dashboards, MEDS, UCSB](images/basic_shiny_app.png)



The **UI** controls the layout and appearance of your app and is written in HTML (but we use functions from the {shiny} package to write that HTML). The **server** handles the logic of the app – in other words, it is a set of instructions that tells the web page what to display when a user interacts with it.

Let's take a look at how the code for a *very simple* Shiny app would look like to get a sense of the fundamental architecture of this tool.

```{r very-basic-shiny}
library(shiny)

# Define the UI
ui <- shiny::fluidPage( # <1>
  "Hello there!"
)

# Define the server
server <- function(input, output){ } # <2>

# Generate the app
shiny::shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

1.  The `fluidPage` is a function that generates a page. It is important for allowing flexibility in UI layout which we'll dive deeper later.

2.  The server is actually a function with input and output as arguments. , where you'll add all the code related to the computations.Because this app has no inputs or outputs, it doesn't need anything in the 'server' component (though it still does require an "empty server")

If we run the code above, we should see an app that is a blank white page with "Hello there!" written in the top left in plain text.

![](images/very-basic-app.png){width="80%"}

With this code we have essentially built a Shiny app. More complicated apps will certainly have more content in the UI and server sections but all Shiny apps will have this tripartite structure (Define UI, Define the Server and Generate the app).

### What will go in each section? {.unnumbered}

+------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Section    | Component                                                                                                                                   |
+============+=============================================================================================================================================+
| **UI**     | -   [Layout](https://shiny.posit.co/r/articles/build/layout-guide/) - how the different components of the app are arranged.                 |
|            |                                                                                                                                             |
|            | -   [Theme](https://shiny.posit.co/r/articles/build/themes/index.html) - defines the overall appearance of your app.                        |
|            |                                                                                                                                             |
|            | -   Inputs - or **widgets** ways the user can interact with (e.g. toggle, slide) and provide values to your app.                            |
|            |                                                                                                                                             |
|            | -   Outputs - The R objects that your user sees (e.g. tables, plots). Outputs respond when a user interacts with or changes an input value. |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Server** | -   Computations - code that will create the outputs displayed in your app (values, tables, plots, etc).                                    |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+


### More on widgets and outputs {.unnumbered}

> Widgets are web elements that users can interact with via the UI.

Widgets collect information from the user which is then used to update outputs created in the server. Shiny provides a set of [standard widgets](https://shiny.posit.co/r/gallery/) (see image below), but you can also explore widget extensions using a variety of other packages (e.g. `{shinyWidgets}`, `{DT}`, `{plotly}`)

![](images/basic-widgets.png){width="80%"}

Outputs are R objects you will display on your app. This can be plots, tables, values, or others. Generally, these outputs are going to react to as the user interact with the inputs.

Example of input widgets and an output plot.

### Reactivity (in brief) 

Reactivity is **what makes Shiny apps responsive** i.e. it lets the app instantly update itself whenever the user makes a change. At a very basic level, it looks something like this:

## How to understand reactivity?

Check out Garrett Grolemund’s article, [_How to understand reactivity_](https://shiny.posit.co/r/articles/build/understanding-reactivity/) in R for a more detailed overview of Shiny reactivity.

## On file organization


Before we jump into RStudio to create a Shiny app there a couple more things worth mentioning about the structure of an app. First, when creating an app you have the option of either creating a **single-file app** or a **two-file app**. The in both cases look the same, however the difference is you either have all the code for you app (ui + server) in one script named `app.R` or you have 2 files, one for ui (`ui.R) and one for then server (server.R)



![Source: Intro to Shiny - Building reactive apps and dashboards, MEDS, UCSB](images/one-vs-two.png)


::: {.callout-caution icon="false"}
## Which one to choose?

It largely comes down to personal preference. A single-file format is best for smaller apps or when creating a reproducible example ([reprex](https://mastering-shiny.org/action-workflow.html#getting-help)). While the two-file format is beneficial when writing large, complex apps where breaking apart code can make things a bit more navigable / maintainable.

<br>

Second, as we have learned through this course, it is always a good idea to create a GitHub repository + an `Rproj` to house all the moving pieces of our app. The image below presents a general repo structure to stay organized. We will follow this structure for the apps we will create during this lesson.

<br>


![Source: Intro to Shiny - Building reactive apps and dashboards, MEDS, UCSB](images/repo-structure-details.png)



## Creating a Shiny app

::: callout-tip
## Set up: Create GitHub Repo

1.  Create a repo to house our soon-to-be app(s). Navigate to your GitHub account, go to Your repositories > Click on New repository. Named it `shiny-app-example` Remember to initiate your repo with a README and choose R as the language for the default `.gitignore`.

2.  Clone your repo into your RStudio Session in the server. Click on the green "< >Code" button > Copy the HTTPS url and then go to RStudio

3. In RStudio Create a new project. Go to File > New Project > Version Control with Git > paste Repository url > Create Project

<br>

<br>

You can create a single-file app using RStudio’s built-in Shiny app template (e.g. File > New Project… > New Directory > Shiny Application), but it’s just as easy to create it from scratch (and you’ll memorize the structure faster!). Let’s do that now.

<br>

::: callout-tip
## Set up: Your first Shiny App

4. In your project repo, create a subdirectory to house your app. Name it `single-file-app`.

5. Create a new R script inside `single-file-app/` and name it `app.R` – you must name your script `app.R`. 

6. Copy or type the following code into `app.R`, or use the `shinyapp` [snippet](https://rstudio.github.io/rstudio-extensions/rstudio_snippets.html) to automatically generate a shiny app template.

```{r}
#| eval: false

# load packages ----
library(shiny)

# user interface ----
ui <- fluidPage()

# server instructions ----
server <- function(input, output) {}

# combine UI & server into an app ----
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)


```


**Tip:** Use code sections (denoted by `# some text ----`) to make navigating different sections of your app code a bit easier. Code sections will appear in your document outline (find the button at the top right corner of the script/editor panel).

:::

 
Once you have saved your `app.R` file, the “Run” code button should turn into a “Run App” button. Click that button to run your app (alternatively, run `runApp("directory-name")` in your console.

```{r}
#| eval: false

runApp("single-file-app")

```

You won’t see much yet, as we have only built a blank app (but a functioning app, nonetheless!).

You should also notice a red stop sign appear in the top right corner of your console indicating that R is busy – this is because your R session is currently acting as your Shiny app server and listening for any user interaction with your app. Because of this, you won’t be able to run any commands in the console until you quit your app. To quit the app you have to press the stop button.



### Building a single-file-app

We are now going to add elements to our base app. We will use data from `{palmerpenguin}` package and add the following features to our app:

1. A title and subtitle
2. A slider widget for users to select a range of penguin body masses
3. A reactive scatterplot that updates based on user-supplied values


![Source: Intro to Shiny - Building reactive apps and dashboards, MEDS, UCSB](images/reactive-app-v1.gif){{fig-align="center"}}


::: {.callout-caution icon="false"}
## About `{palmerpenguin}`
The [`palmerpenguins` data](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) contains size measurements for three penguin species (Chinstrap, Gentoo and Adelie) observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica (Torgersen, Biscoe, and Dream).
:::


### Adding text to the UI: Title and Subtitle {.unnumberd}

We will do this in the **UI** withing `fluidPage()`. Remember this is a layout function that creates the basic visual structure of your app page.

Let's add a title and subtitle to our app. Make sure they are separated with a coma!

```{r}
# user interface ----
ui <- fluidPage(
  
  # app title ----
  "My App Title",
  
  # app subtitle ----
  "Exploring Antarctic Penguin Data"
  
  )
```


### Style text in the UI {.unnumberd}

The **UI** is actually just an HTML document. We can style our text by adding static HTML elements using tags – a list of functions that parallel common HTML tags (e.g. <h1> == tags$h1()) The most common tags also have wrapper functions (e.g. h1()).

```{r}
# user interface ----
ui <- fluidPage(
  
  # app title ----
  tags$h1("My App Title"), # alternatively, you can use the `h1()` wrapper function
  
  # app subtitle ----
  h4(strong("Exploring Antarctic Penguin Data")) # alternatively, `tags$h4(tags$strong("text"))`
  
  )
```

### Adding intupts and outputs {.unnumbered}

Next, we will begin to add some inputs and outputs to our **UI inside** `fluidPage()`. Anything that you put into `fluidPage()` will appear in our app’s user interface. We want inputs and outputs to show up there.

#### Step 1: add an input to your app (slider widget) {.unnumbered}


```{r}
# user interface ----
ui <- fluidPage(
  
  # app title ----
  tags$h1("My App Title"), # alternatively, you can use the `h1()` wrapper function
  
  # app subtitle ----
  h4(strong("Exploring Antarctic Penguin Data")), # alternatively, `tags$h4(tags$strong("text"))`
  
  # body mass slider input ----
  sliderInput(inputId = "body_mass_input", label = "Select a range of body masses (g):",
              min = 2700, max = 6300, value = c(3000, 4000))
  
  )
```

#### Step 2: add an output "placeholder" in the UI {.unnumbered}

Outputs in the UI create **placeholders** which are later filled by the server function.

Similar to input functions, all output functions take the same first argument, `outputId` (note Id not ID), **which connects the front end UI with the back end server**. For example, if your UI contains an output function with an `outputId = "plot"`, the server function will access it (or in other words, know to place the plot in that particular placeholder) using the syntax `output$plot`.

```{r}
# user interface ----
ui <- fluidPage(
  
  # app title ----
  tags$h1("My App Title"), # alternatively, you can use the `h1()` wrapper function
  
  # app subtitle ----
  h4(strong("Exploring Antarctic Penguin Data")), # alternatively, `tags$h4(tags$strong("text"))`
  
  # body mass slider input ----
  sliderInput(inputId = "body_mass_input", label = "Select a range of body masses (g):",
              min = 2700, max = 6300, value = c(3000, 4000)),
  
  # body mass plot ouput ----
  plotOutput(outputId = "bodyMass_scatterplot_output")
  
  )
```

Okay, it looks like nothing changed?? Remember, `*Output()` functions **create placeholders, but we have not yet written the server instructions on how to fill and update those placeholders**. We can inspect the HTML and see that there is, in fact, a placeholder area awaiting our eventual output, which will be a plot named “bodyMass_scatterplot_output”:

![Source: Intro to Shiny - Building reactive apps and dashboards, MEDS, UCSB](images/output-placeholder.png){{fig-align="center"}}

### Tell the server how to assemble inputs into outputs: Adding reactive scatterplot {.unnumbered}

Now that we’ve designed our input / output in the UI, we need to write the server instructions (i.e. write the server function) on how to use the input value(s) (i.e. penguin body mass range via a slider input) to update the output (scatter plot).

The **server function** is defined with two arguments, `input` and `output`, both of which are list-like objects. You must define both of these arguments within the server function. `input` contains the values of all the different inputs at any given time, while `output` is where you’ll save output objects to be displayed in the app.

**RULES**
1. Save objects you want to display to `output$<id>`
2. Build reactive objects using a `render*()` function
3. Access input values with input$<id>
 

#### Save objects you want to display to `output$<id>` {.unnumbered}

```{r}
# load packages ----
library(shiny)

# user interface ----
ui <- fluidPage(
  
  # ~ previous code omitted for brevity ~
  
  # body mass slider ----
  sliderInput(inputId = "body_mass_input", label = "Select a range of body masses (g):",
              min = 2700, max = 6300, value = c(3000, 4000)),
  
  # body mass plot output ----
  plotOutput(outputId = "bodyMass_scatterplot_output") 
  
)

# server instructions ----
server <- function(input, output) {
  
  # render penguin scatter plot ----
  output$bodyMass_scatterplot_output <- # code to generate plot here
  
}
```


**Note:** In the UI, our `outputId` is quoted ("bodyMass_scatterplot_output"), **but not** in the server (bodyMass_scatterplot_output).


#### Build reactive objects with `render*()` {.unnumbered}

Each `*Output()` function in the UI is coupled with a `render*()` function in the server, which contains the “instructions” for creating the output based on user inputs (or in other words, the instructions for making your output reactive).


```{r}
# load packages ----
library(shiny)

# user interface ----
ui <- fluidPage(
  
  # ~ previous code omitted for brevity ~
  
  # body mass slider ----
  sliderInput(inputId = "body_mass_input", label = "Select a range of body masses (g):",
              min = 2700, max = 6300, value = c(3000, 4000)),
  
  # body mass plot output ----
  plotOutput(outputId = "bodyMass_scatterplot_output") 
  
)

# server instructions ----
server <- function(input, output) {
  
  # render penguin scatter plot ----
  output$bodyMass_scatterplot_output <- renderPlot({
    
     # code to generate plot here
    
  }) 
}
```
